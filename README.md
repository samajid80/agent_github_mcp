1- There are two files (one for OpenAI LLM, and other is for gemini LLM).  
2- Enter variables for the examples to work.  
3- GITHUB_PAT is Github Personal Access Token, you can get it from github settings->developer setings page.  
4- TRACING_KEY is used for tracing dashboard. You can get it from  platform.openai.com  
5- I only allowed two remote tools named 'get_me' and 'search_repositories'.  
6- mcp_client.py is openAI version and you can repeatedly query the LLM. if you want to quit just type quit and press enter.
